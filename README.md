## Overview
so i implemented the 26 second music player(ðŸ˜‚ thats the longest songs are on this player) using spotify Api but by using the [client Credential flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/client-credentials/), so that users can use this app without logging into their spotify account

### The challenge


Users should be able to:

- search for songs, with autoCompletion
- play songs
- visit artist page displaying their top songs

### Screenshot
so at first it looks like the image below, appalling right, yeah i know, real example of don't judge a book by its coverðŸ˜‚ 
![](./src/Musik/homePage.PNG)

from the homePage straight away you can play songs just by clicking the play icon,
when you click play the awsome custom player appears
![](./src/Musik/homePage1.PNG)

the page becomes less apalling when you start searching for songs, just start typing the name of any artist or song that intrests you
![](./src/Musik/homePageSearch.PNG)

in the artist Card that appears and you'll be navigated to an artist page with the artist's top songs
